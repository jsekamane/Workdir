# Project Description

Butler and Neuhoff (2008) explored the policies aimed at promoting wind power in the UK and Germany. They find that all the policies they investigate have serious pros and cons - no single policy can combine economic efficiency and ecological goals.

**OUR APPROACH** is to extend this descriptive analysis to include Lithuania, and also extend the analysis to include other sources of renewable energy. Our aim is to provide economical efficient policy suggestions for Lithuania, or any country at an earlier stage of renewable energy adoption, based on the experiences from UK and Germany.
