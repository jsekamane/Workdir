However in the first years of deployment we see that capacity often doubles on a year-to-year basis, for this reason we have slightly adjusted the method; and use installed capacity (MW) lagged one year. This measure seems better attuned to the fast capacity expansion and the dates where production permit are issued. \footnote{We calculate that 42% of all wind power production permits in Lithuania are issued in november and december (using data from NCC, 2012), probably due to seasonal construction patterns and the financial calendar year.} The measure can be interpreted as; how much the country produces during this year, with the capacity it had available at the beginning of this year â€“ instead of the capacity available at the end of this year).
