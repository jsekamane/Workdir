# Introduction (Draft I)

*HOW THE INTRODUCTION IS STRUCTURED*:
* Short overview of RES-E in Lithuania (energy production, policy so fare, goals)
* Short introduction to *Butler and Neuhoff (2008)* and their findings.
* Whats new in UK and DE, since the first paper.
* Structure of paper

## Short history of Lithuanian Energy sector/production
In 1990 Lithuania had a 97% share of imported energy, primarily from Russia. The main objective of the government the last two decades has been to increase local production and support energy efficiency (Galinis, Konstantinaviciute, Miskinis and Norvaisa, 2011). In 2009 the share of Russian imported energy was down to 56%, however in December 2009 the last section of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was shut down, resulting in the Russian imported energy share shooting up to 80% in 2010. The Lithuanian electricity transmission system and the european electricity transmission system is not currently connected, leaving a limited number of countries where import of electricity is a possiblity.

## Targets / goals
In light of this the National Energy Independence Strategy (2012) has put forward a number of challenages; security of energy supply, competitiveness and sustainability of the energy sector. These challenges are addressed in various ways including; a Liqified Natural Gas terminal (commissioned to open 2015) that will increase competition in the gas market, the Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant (commissioned to open in 2020), a Lituanian-Polish power line (start-up in 2015 and extended in 2020) and a Lithuanian-Swedish power line (completed by 2015) that will enable synchronous interconnection between the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian electricty transmission system and the European Continental Network, ENTSO-E. 
Renewable energy is big part of the solution, and a goal of 23% renewable energy (20% renewable electricity) by 2020 has been set. 
[*Galinis el at. (2010)* find that a target of 26-29% renewable energy by 2020 should be achievable.]

## RES incentive policies in Lithuania today
[Why create incentives? (market failure, CO2 reduction, or ?]

Lituania introduced feed-in tariffs in 2002 (wind from 2007?) these will be maintained until 2020 (Procedure, 2001). The feed-in tariffs were revised in 2007 and 2009 … and in 2010 a purchase price for solar PV generated electricity was introduced.

In addition to feed-in tariffs renweable electricity generators recive a 40% discount on connection to the network of operating energy companies, EU Structural Funds provid support for investments in power plants that generate electricity from renewable sources and soft loans are provided by the Lituanian Envireomental Investment Fund for financing energy projects.

## Renewable energy to date in LT
Current renewable energy … (Statistics Lithuania, 2012).

"further exploitation of hydro resources is limited: hydro resources of small rivers are already used up, whereas utilization of bigger rivers Nemunas and Neris requires extensive investments and solution of environmental issues" Katinas, *Markevicius, Erlickyte and Marciukaitis (2008)*

Biofuel. (argiculture intensity measure - lowest in EU).

"… it is planned that this target will be reached in 2017. This limit in the National Plan is based on the conclusion that total capacity of wind power plants larger than 500 MW could have a negative impact on balance of power in the Lithuanian power system and could be a barrier for its planned synchronous operation with ENTSO-E … "

"deployment of small generators in Lithuania is going comparatively slowly [compared to eastern europe] and barriers are deeper than the technical problems of their connection to the grid. These barriers could be divided into three main groups: regulatory, business practices and technical barriers." … *Galinis el al. (2011).*



## Introduction to B & N (2008) article
UK and DE wind power 1990 to 2006.
Effectiveness of policies based on two messures; "(1) the price of power generated and (2) the capacity installed."
[(3) How precise you hit the target]
…
"Butler and Neuhoff (2008) find that Germany’s feed-in tariff scheme increases wind energy deployment with a lower resource- adjusted cost to society than the quantity-based UK Renewables Obligation."
… 
In addition they conducted an analyzed a survey of project developers and found;
"Project developers do not compete in price but for good sites under the feed-in tariff."
"*Mitchell and Connor [14]* observed that the structure of the NFFO has exacerbated the difficulties associated with obtaining planning consent. This is in contrast to the situation under the German feed-in tariff. As the tariff adjusts to the available wind resource, it allows developers to pursue projects in a wider set of locations."

## Whats new in UK and DE
… in 2010 the UK implemented feed-in tariffs [however voluntary for some utlilies as early as may 2009 *Scarpa and Willis (2009)*]…

## Our approach
Extend the comparative analysis of the resources-adjusted cost to include Lithuania … policy evaluation of thier feed-in tariff system. [WHY INCLUDE LT? New/just started, special limitation/features (500MW, Small country/not flexible/not intergrated)]
Supplement the policy evaluation with a survey among LT project developers, that uncovers the barriers in/outside the tariff system that limit wind energy development in LT.

[Prehaps also supplement the effectiveness of policy using the method of the 2008 IEA report Deploying Renewables: Principles for Effective Policies … "by comparing actual RES-E deployment with national policy types and remuneration levels (*IEA 2008*). The study derives a “quantitative policy effectiveness indicator” for 35 different countries, dividing each country’s average increase in renewable energy by its remaining RES-E potential realizable by 2020"]

## Structure of paper
The paper is structured as follows …


* Comparing installed capacity
* Comparing wind resources (Generation from installed capacity)
* Then "Expected average remuneration under the EEG and the RO.", since the ROC price from years 2002-2006 is used in fig. 1.
* … 
* And last the "Anticipated price of wind energy in Germany and the UK"
