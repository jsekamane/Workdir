# Introduction (Draft I)

## [Short history of Lithuanian Energy sector/production]
In 1990 Lithuania had a 97% share of imported energy, primarily from Russia. The main objective of the government the last two decades has been to increase local production and support energy efficiency (Galinis, Konstantinaviciute, Miskinis and Norvaisa, 2011). In 2009 the share of Russian imported energy was down to 56%, however in December 2009 the last reactor of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania was shut down, resulting in the Russian imported energy share shooting up to 80% in 2010. Before the shutting down of The Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant commenced in 2004, the power plant had a 41% share of total available capacity. Gas imported come from a single source – Russia. The Lithuanian electricity transmission system and the european electricity transmission system is not currently connected, leaving a limited number of countries where import of electricity is a possibility.

## [Targets / goals]
In light of this the National Energy Independence Strategy (2012) has put forward a number of challenages; security of energy supply, competitiveness and sustainability of the energy sector. These challenges are addressed in various ways including; a Liquified Natural Gas terminal (commissioned to open 2015) that will open up the Lithuanian gas market to more suppliers and thereby increase competition, the Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant (commissioned to open in 2020), a Lithuanian-Polish power line (start-up in 2015 and extended in 2020) and a Lithuanian-Swedish power line (completed by 2015) that will enable synchronous interconnection between the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian electricity transmission system and the European Continental Network, ENTSO-E. 
Renewable energy is also heavily included as part of the solution, as it directly addresses all three challenges. A goal of 23% renewable energy (20% renewable electricity) by 2020 has been set. 
[*Galinis el at. (2010)* find that a target of 26-29% renewable energy by 2020 should be achievable.]

## [RES incentive policies in Lithuania today]
Lituania introduced feed-in tariffs in 2002 these will be maintained until 2020 (Procedure, 2001). The feed-in tariffs were revised in 2007 and 2009 to adjust for inflation [Confirmation required] and in 2010 a purchase price for solar PV generated electricity was introduced.

In addition to feed-in tariffs renewable electricity generators receive a 40% discount on connection to the network of operating energy companies, EU Structural Funds provide support for investments in power plants that generate electricity from renewable sources and soft loans are provided by the Lithuanian Environmental Investment Fund for financing energy projects.

## [Renewable energy to date in LT]
[INSERT TABLE=table_production-electricity-2011.csv TITLE=Total gross production of electricity in 2011 in Lithuania SOURCE=Statistics Lithuania (2012, Table 2.40)]

Current electicity production in Lithuania is presented in table XXX. The majority of production is based on fossil fuel. Hydroelectric plants and pumped storage produced 1.056GHw (21.9%) in 2010, but further exploitation of hydro is limited. The small rivers are already being used, and developing hydro at the bigger rivers Nemunas and Neris face environmental issues (Markevicius, Erlickyte and Marciukaitis 2008). Production from wind turbines has been rapidly increasing the last couple of years and are up from a production of 224GWh (3.9%) in 2010 to 475GWh (9.9%) in 2011. Electricty from solar plants has so fare been negligible. Biomass is undoubtedly the largest renewable energy source in Lithuania, but has not been used for production of eletricity nor has biogas (Statistics Lithuania 2012) [argiculture intensity measure - lowest in EU].

The National Energy Independece Strategy sets the capacity limit of wind power plants at 500MW. Galinis el al. (2011) note that a capacity above "could have a negative impact on balance of power in the Lithuanian power system and could be a barrier for its planned synchronous operation with ENTSO-E". Marciukaitis (2011) writes that if the electricity network was expanded "real wind energy potential is estimated to reach 1000 MW. Additionally about 1000 MW of offshore wind farms". The National Energy Independece Strategy sets these 500MW as its target for wind power plants, and expects this target to be reached by 2017. A taget of 355MW by 2020 has been set for biofuel plants.

## [Introduction to B & N (2008) article]
Butler and Neuhoff (2008) explored the policies aimed at promoting wind power in the UK and Germany from 1990 to 2006. The UK operates under Renewables Obligation (RO) which is a green certificate system, while Germany makes use of a feed-in tarrif system. Comparing resource-adjusted cost to society they find Germany's feed-in tarrif system increase deployment with the lowest cost. Their effectiveness of policies is based on two messures: (1) the price of power generated and (2) the capacity installed. [(3) How precise you hit the target]

In addition they conducted a survey among project developers, undercovering barriers to development and level of competition among developers and other firms in the industry. Here they find that project developers in Germany compete for good sites rather than price, since "the tariff adjusts to the available wind resource, it allows developers to pursue projects in a wider set of locations."

## [Whats new in UK and DE]
Since Butler and Neuhoff paper was published there as been some changes in the UK and Germany. 
In 2010 the UK implemented feed-in tariffs that works alongside the RO system [however voluntary for some utlilies as early as may 2009 *Scarpa and Willis (2009)*]. The feed-in tariffs are aimed at increasing development of small-scale (less than 5MW), while the focus of RO is still development of large-scale. Solar photovoltaic has dominated the first year of installements with 77.7MW, four times more than, the second most installed, wind at 18.9MW (Ofgem 2011).

[What else is new in the UK?]
[What is new in Germany!?]

## [Our approach]
Our approach is to extend the comparative analysis of the resources-adjusted cost to include Lithuania. In doing this we provide the reader with a policy evaluation of the feed-in tariff system of Lithuania. We do not just compare it to an other feed-in tariff system, but also compare it with a green certificate based system. We will supplement the policy evaluation with a survey among lituanian project developers and uncover the barriers both within and outside the tariff system, that might limit wind energy development in Lituania.

[We also supplement the effectiveness of policy using the method of the 2008 IEA report (IEA 2008). Here we compare actual electricty from renewable energy sources deployment with the national policy types and with the remuneration levels.]

But why Lithuania, you might ask. Because Lithuania shares the characteristics of the majority of other countries in the world. Lithuania has some special limitations and features that translate quite easily to alot of other countries; its at an very eary stage of wind power development and an early stage of creating effective policy incentives, its a small country where low wind speeds in one part of the country are not simply compensated by high wind speeds in another part, its not intergrated into a large eletricty transmission system and its a small economy where its investments and remuneration levels are constraint by resources. We motivate the choice of Lithuania by the fact that its a representative country and the methods and conclusions presented here might therefore serve other coutries, who also share the characteristics.

## [Structure of paper]
The paper is structured as follows …

[Temporary:]
* Comparing installed capacity
* Comparing wind resources (Generation from installed capacity)
* Then "Expected average remuneration under the EEG and the RO.", since the ROC price from years 2002-2006 is used in fig. 1.
* … 
* And last the "Anticipated price of wind energy in Germany and the UK"
