# Policy effectiveness (Draft I)

We will first have a look at deployment levels. Thereafter quickly introduce the respective wind resources or wind speeds in each country, which we will later use to adjust costs. We will also do a couple of calculations on ROC prices for later use. We will end up evaluating prices or remuneration levels to see if the different deployment levels we found, are a result of the different remuneration levels, when adjusted for the wind resources of each country.

## Comparing installed capacity / deployment level

[This might have to be share of consumption (%), since imports might otherwise overemphasise the upward trends]

Both Germany and the UK introduced renewable energy incentive policies around the same time, 1991 and 1990 respectively. Deployment has been much greater in Germany compared to the UK as seen in figure XXX. In Germany deployment increased steadily after the first national policy was introduced, incentivising electricity production from renewable energy sources. Deployment in the UK remained low under the NFFO system and only started to pick up after the RO system was introduced in 2002, but both the NFFO and RO have under-preformed with regards to the targets set by government (Dow and Wood 2011). Lithuania has arrived much later at the game. First introducing feed-in tariffs in 2002. Its deployment in absolute terms (MW) has been slower than both Germany and the UK. However the rate at which *wind power as percentage of total electricity production* has increased, has been faster as seen in figure XXX – surpassing the UK in 2010 and Germany in 2011 (Statistisches Bundesamt 2012, Statistics Lithuania 2012).

## Comparing wind speeds and wind resources - generation from installed capacity
[INSERT FIGURE=figure_generation-capacity_lag.pdf TITLE=Generation from installed capacity lagged one period (MWh/MW_-1) TIME=1991-2010 SOURCE=Eurostat (nrg_113a, nrg_1072) NOTE=Includes both onshore and offshore wind turbines. Sum of main activity producers and autoproducers]

[Double check and make table - add notes, equations and sources]
DE: 5.5 m/s (30m) - Reference site
LT: 6.3 m/s (30m) - Average of 3 measurements, comparable to DE.
UK: 7.2 m/s (30m) - Average wind speed UK, comparable to DE.

".. power production increases non-linearly with wind speed… [we assume that a turbine at an existing UK location will achieve at least 150% of the output the same turbine would achieve at the German reference site]"

To acutely compare the costs in Germany, the UK and Lithuania we will adjust according to each countries wind resources. The UK is endowed with stronger winds and therefore its costs of producing one MWh will be lower than Germany and Lithuania. Following the procedure of Butler and Neuhoff (2008, 2004) we will not use country average wind speeds, since they might not correspond to wind speeds at the sites that are accessible to project developers. Instead we will look at the electricity generated relative to the installed capacity (MWh/MW). This measure is also called annual full load hours (h/a), since it corresponds to the number of hours where a wind turbine has to produce at its maximum capacity. This will serve as a crude measure of the output of all operational wind turbines. In the first years of deployment, capacity often double on a year-to-year basis, for this reason we have slightly adjusted the method, using installed capacity (MW) lagged one year. This measure is better attuned to the fast expansion of capacity, since [reason!? Lagged puts more weight on turbines installed in the last half of a year, where non-lagged puts more weight on turbines installed in first half of a year!? Seasonal construction and wind power variability!? Are the results later on in this paper robust to this adjustment!? "How much did you produces this year, with the capacity you had available at the end of last year" vs "How much did you produce this year, with the capacity you will have available in the end of this year"!?]. 

[Consider moving the following paragraph about diff. tariffs!]
It is important to note that neither the NFFO or RO in the UK, nor the feed-in tariffs in Lithuania, differentiate with respect to wind resources. While the German feed-in tariffs from 2000 and onwards offer higher tariffs for less windy sites. \footnote{High preforming sites reaching 150% of the performance of a reference site receive 9.1-7.9 c/kWh for five years and thereafter 6.2-5.4 c/kWh. While for low preforming sites the 9.1-7.9 c/kWh rate is extended after the 5 years, by two months for every 0.75% the low sites are below the 150% reference site. These rate where revised in 2004, 2009 and 2012 (Lauber and Mez 2004. EEG 2012).} This is important since it has implications for the order in which different sites/regions are developed and thier profitablily.
When tariffs are not differentiated, the least favorable site sets marginal price. In the beginning when installed capacity is low, project developers will focus on the sites with high wind speeds. As deployment expands, sites with increasingly lower wind speeds will be used, and the increased remuneration levels required at these sites will set marginal price. This leads to the turbines located at the high wind speed sites capturing scarcity rents. By differentiating tariffs according to the wind resources available, high scarcity rents can be avoided.
[Indicators of scarcity: Ragwitz, Huber, Resch, White (2003 tabel 3.25) estimated that in 2001 Germany had achived 26% of its mid-term potential electricity generation from on-shore wind power, while the UK had only achived 4.1%.]

Figure XXX presents the electricity production from the lagged installed capacity. Because of the better wind resources we see, as we expected, that output is higher in the UK compared to Germany, with exception of the early 1990s. Butler and Neuhoff (2008) explains that this initial low output in the UK was "due to low turbine ratings at experimental sites, but increased with the increase in turbine rating throughout the 1990s" and they further note that the "increase in hub height – thus capturing higher wind speeds – has contributed to the upward trend [in the UK and has prevented a further decrease in output per turbine in Germany]". Caution is advised when evaluating the output of Lithuania in 2004-2005, since the numbers are very sensitive to rounding and measurements errors. \footnote{Capacity was reported to be 1 MW in both years, while electricity generated was reported respectively as 1 and 2 GWh in those years by EUROSTAT. The National Control Commission for Prices and Energy reported that they had issued permits that cumulative had capacities of 0.85 and 0.99 MW (NCC 2006, table 41), while the European Wind Energy Association reports installed capacity of 7 MW in both years (EWEA 2006). Statistics Lithuania report electricity generated as 1.2 and 1.8 GWh (Statistics Lithuania 2006).} After 2006 the Lithuanian output is situated in the vicinity of the output of the UK [reflecting that wind deployment has accrued in the locations where wind resources are highest? or at least comparable to that of the UK].

## Price paid under ROC
We will now take a closer look at the prices paid for wind energy; first calculating the value of ROC in the UK, thereafter comparing prices across countries taking wind resources into account. Butler and Neuhoff (2008, p. 1855) motivate their choice to focus on the price paid to wind generators for energy, rather than on the overall cost of support, since "the overall cost would also include network expansion costs and balancing costs, to which wind generators in Germany are not exposed, and which can be separated in the UK"

[INSERT FIGURE=figure_roc-price-components.pdf TITLE=Components of the Price Paid to Wind Energy under ROC (p/KWh) TIME=2002-2021 SOURCE=… NOTE=… ]

The UK's Tradable Green Certificate are called Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs). Energy suppliers have to present a certain number of ROCs each year (XX% in 20XX), this is monitored by Ofgem. ROCs can been bought from renewable energy generators (1 ROC = 1 MWh). The value of ROCs is not simply equivalent to the market price of the traded ROCs, since the RO system also allows suppliers to pay a fixed amount to Ofgem for each MWh (buy-out price) above the requirement, that they have not covered with a ROC. Other factors of the RO system also affect the value of ROCs and we will go through these in the following paragraphs.
When calculating the value of ROCs we will follow the approach first presented by Bauknecht, Connor and Mitchell (2006). This is also the approach taken by Butler and Neuhoff, but we have updated several assumptions to fit the newest projections and price developments. We aim a providing a lower bound of the value of ROCs [WHY???].
The buy-out price was set at £30/MWh (3p/KWh) in 2002/2003, when the RO system was introduced and it increases annually with the Retail Price Index \footnote{The buy-out price also works as an cap on RO expenditures. It insures that consumers will note pay more than 3p/KWh on xx% of their electricity (Bauknecht, Connor and Mitchell 2006, p. 300)}. The electricity suppliers have an economic interest in buying renewable energy up to £30/MWh above the market price of conventional electricity. If the electricity price of renewables was above, then suppliers would instead buy conventional electricity from the market, and pay the buy-out price. In line with Butler and Neuhoff we assume that from 2010 the buy-out price falls with technology (0.20p/KWh annually), see figure XXX.
The buy-out funds collected each year are redistributed to those suppliers that have meet their requirements. These recycled funds further increase the premium above market price, at which suppliers are willing to buy renewable energy, and hence increase the value of ROCs. This is denoted Recycled Green Premium in figure xxx. Butler and Neuhoff assumed that the UK would meet their renewable energy targets in 2010/2011 and the recycled green premium thereafter would fall to zero. As noted earlier the UK has consistently under-preformed with regards to the targets set by the government. [Maybe include the RO fulfilment %, from Ofgem annual report] We instead assume the target will be meet in 2015, and the premium will fall until then.
Levy Exception Certificate (LEC) exempts renewable energy generators from the Climate Change Levy. Butler and Neuhoff assumed this fixed at 0.22p/KWh (50% of the 2007/2008 level). We use the actual rate for the first 10 years and considering its stability, we assume the future rate will remain at the 2010/2011 level.
The ROC is an additional revenue source for renewable energy generators, but like all energy generators the energy they produce is sold to the market and constitutes the primary revenue source. We calculate the energy value as the auction price for wind in the NFPA auction, minus the ROC auction price and the value of LEC.\footnote{The auction prices for wind will include the value ROCs and LECs (NFPA 2012).} In line with Butler and Neuhoff we assume that energy value falls with technology (to 1.5p/KWh in 2020) [bottom end of the range predicted by the Performance and Innovation Unit (2002)]. [CONSIDER: Including the price comparison figure from B&N (fig. 3) - find UXPX wholesale price]
In 2005 (???) the European Emission Trading Scheme was introduced. It increases fossil fuel (opportunity) cost of electricity generation, this is CO2 prices in figure xxx. From 2007 and on, Butler and Neuhoff assume a fixed CO2 price of 22.77 €/tCO2, but since then the CO2 price has fallen from a levels around 20 and 22 €/tCO2 (in 2005 and 2008) down to 7.5 €/tCO2 in 2012 \footnote{[INCLUDE: Description of why the CO2 prices has changed as they have - see CCC (2008) report]}. Therefore we will base our assumption on the central case price projection made in the Committee on Climate Change report (2008, p. 162). They set prices at 16 €/tCO2 in 2020, and slightly lower in 2015. We assume a fixed cost of 16 euro/tCO2 this corresponding to to 1.2 p/kWh contribution.\footnote{In addition we assume an exchange rate of 1.5 (lower bound) and a conversion factor of 0.5 corresponding to the latest available level (2010 level).}

By taking advantage of newest available data and updating the assumptions we find that the sum of all ROC components is higher than the value Butler and Neuhoff (2008) found. This of course also leads to the compounded UK prices, calculated in the coming sections, being considerably higher.

Above we briefly described each ROC component as well as its past and future price developments. The sum of all components gives us an projection of what the ROC value wind producers in the UK can expect in each year until 2021. Using this and the tariff rates from Germany and Lithuania we will be able to make a simple price comparison for the years 2002-2021 – this is done in the following section. And later extend with an the elaborate price comparison where also price inflation and wind resources are taken into account.

## Expected average remuneration under the EEG and the RO
[INSERT FIGURE=fig_expected-average-remuneration.pdf TITLE=Expected remuneration level (2002-2021). TIME=2002-2021 SOURCE=… NOTE=… ]

In this section we will calculate prices that are comparable across the three systems, despite the fact that prices, rates and the length of support differs widely under each system. The procedure is as follows; We will calculate the net present value of a newly build wind turbine for each year from 2002 to 2021. We assume a discount factor of 8% and payback time of 20 years, e.g. we evaluate the investment by looking at the cash flow in the first 20 years after the turbine is been build. Then we calculate constant annual rates that would yield identical net present values, since this rate or remuneration level for each year will be comparable across the three systems, and takes account of the system differences mentioned above. The results of this procedure are presented in figure xxx.

In the UK we use the value of ROC that we calculated in the previous section. For each year between 2002-2021 we use the corresponding ROC value. For years after 2021 we simply assume a constant value of 3 p/KWh \footnote{Assuming a constant price of 3 p/KWh for years after 2021 is similar to, but not mentioned in, Butler and Neuhoff (2008) and therefore this number has been found by method of trial-and-error.}. 

In Germany we assume that wind tubbiness produce 150% above the reference site, and are therefore paid a five year high initial fee followed by 15 years basic fee. We also apply the degression mechanism of the EEG system. It decreases initial and basic fees with 1-2% annually. The EEG system has been revised three times since it was introduced in 2000 - in 2004, 2009 and 2012 - each revision has adjusted fees and degression rates.

In Lithuania renewable energy producers are guaranteed the feed-in tariff rates for 12 years. After 12 years we assume the producers are paid the pool price of 1.5 c/KWh [??? Why this 1.5 the pool price?]. The feed in tariff rates have been adjusted twice since its introduction in 2002 - in 2009 and 2012. The 2012 adjustment introduced differentiated tariffs based on the size of the wind project. For projects smaller than 30 KW a tariff of 10.71 c/KWh is paid, between 30 KW and 350 the tariff is 10.42 c/KWh, and above 350 KW the tariff is 8.11 c/KWh. To this date only two wind projects below 30 KW have been developed; moreover mid-size projects account for 68% of all projects while large-sized project account for 29%. It is too early to predict the future distribution of the size of wind projects. Therefore we will use the simple average of these three rates, and set the price to 9.75 c/KWh from 2012 and onwards \footnote{A weighted average, were weights are the current number of projects in each size, increases the price with 0.25 c/KWh.}.

This simple comparison of remuneration levels reveals that ROC remuneration levels are considerably higher than EEG levels and presumable will remain higher until the end of 2010s. Butler and Neuhoff (2008) estimated ROC remuneration levels that stayed below 7 p/KWh, our estimates are significantly higher due to the UK not reaching their 2010 target levels and therefore recoiled green premium has not yet converging to zero, and due to wind energy auction prices in 2008 being 2 p/KWh higher than their estimates. We also see that the Lithuanian remuneration levels were lower than German until 2009, when they were adjusted upwards due to low development [Add source on low development claim]. This simple comparison though insightful, does not take the wind speeds nor inflation rates into account. In the next section we will make these adjustments and compare the prices for years 1990-2010. 

## Anticipated price of wind energy in Germany and the UK
[INSERT FIGURE=fig_anticipated-price-energy.pdf TITLE=Anticipated price of wind energy (1990-2010). TIME=1990-2010 SOURCE=… NOTE=… ]

In this section we have applied the same procedure to the NFFO auction prices and the StrEG prices; calculating net present values for each year, and then calculating a corresponding constant remuneration level. In addition we use the remuneration levels calculated in the previous section for years 2002-2010 (2000-2010 in the case of Germany). But in this section we take account of inflation by deflating the remuneration levels using the respective retail price index. And we take account of different wind speeds, as Butler and Neuhoff (2008, p. 1858) write "If, for example, output [of wind tubbiness in the UK] is 20% higher, then the price paid per MWh can be reduced by 20% [in Germany …] maintaining the same revenue stream for the project and creating little additional maintenance costs". When adjusting for UK wind speeds we multiply remuneration levels with the full load hours over full load hours in the UK - our crude measure of output from a previous section (see figure generation-capacity).

Five NFFO auction rounds were completed before the ROC system was introduced in 2002. NFFO 1-2 guaranteed the NFFO auction price until 1998, while the NFFO 3-5 guaranteed prices for 15 years, for years after this we assume wind tubbiness receive a pool price of 1.5 p/KWh. [Why different pool prices ??? 1.5 here and 3 in the previous section ???]

The StrEG system was introduced in 1991, and guaranteed renewable energy producers 90% of final consumer electricity prices \footnote{Electricity transmission system exhibited significant loss as electricity is transmitted from power plants through the grid to final consumers. Therefore the prices final consumers will pay when they draw electricity from the grid is much higher than the price that (non-renewable) producers receive when delivering electricity to the grid. The 90% will therefore give renewable energy producers a premium relative to non-renewable.}. For each year we use the corresponding StrEG price. For the years after 2000, where the StrEG system has been replaced by the EEG system, we assume four years of a high initial fee (similar fees as in year 2000), followed by the basic fee for remaining years \footnote{This is similar to, but again not mentioned in, Butler and Neuhoff (2008) and has been found by method of trial-and-error, using hints from the EEG law (2000) were it is stated that operation time of prior installation is halved (but to minimum 4 years) and after that prior installation follow same reduction of rate rules as new installations.}.

Butler and Neuhoff (2008) and others conclude that although the the NFFO system was historically thought of as a system that effectively would reduce costs, relative to a feed-in tariff systems – when taking the period of support, inflation and wind resources into account this does not seem to be the case. The NFFO system also suffered from several other problems, as discussed in XXXXX (20XX), XXXXXX (20XX) and XXXXX (20XX). Wood and Dow (2011, p. 2229) argue that the RO system, although it removed the problem of renewable energy subsidies being bundled together with nuclear energy, it "introduced three new failures (two internal and one external)", and has not corrected the other failures that exist.

While Lithuanian remuneration levels have been quite stable as seen in the previous section, the inflation adjusted comparison of prices paints a different picture. [Because of relative unstable inflation levels in LT, compared to the UK or DE, the Lithuania government might be over-compensating wind producers in real terms. So far they have been "saved" by large price falls following the financial crisis.]. When also adjusting for wind resources we see that prices are below German, e.g. Lithuania has achieved relative high deployment levels while providing lower compensation to wind power prodders. [Expand on these conclusions]
