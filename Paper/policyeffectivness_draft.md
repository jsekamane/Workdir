Both Germany and the UK introduced renewable energy incentive policies around the same time (1991 and 1990 respectively). Deployment has been much greater in Germany compared to the UK as seen in figure XXX. In Germany deployment increased steadily after the first policy was introduced. While deployment in the UK remained low under the NFFO system and only started to pick up after the RO system was introduced in 2002. Both the NFFO and RO have under-preformed with regards to the targets set by government (Dow and Wood 2011). Lithuania has arrived much later at the game – first introducing feed-in tariffs in 2002. [Al though its deployment in % of total electricity produced has been faster than Germany and the UK (find statistics), it deployment in absolute terms (MW) has been slower as seen in figure XXX.]
