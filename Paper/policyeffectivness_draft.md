## Comparing installed capacity

Both Germany and the UK introduced renewable energy incentive policies around the same time, 1991 and 1990 respectively. Deployment has been much greater in Germany compared to the UK as seen in figure XXX. In Germany deployment increased steadily after the first national policy was introduced, incentivicing electricity production from renewable energy sources. Deployment in the UK remained low under the NFFO system and only started to pick up after the RO system was introduced in 2002, but both the NFFO and RO have under-preformed with regards to the targets set by government (Dow and Wood 2011). Lithuania has arrived much later at the game. First introducing feed-in tariffs in 2002. Its deployment in absolute terms (MW) has been slower than both Germany and the UK. However the rate at which *wind power as percentage of total electricity production* has increased, has been faster as seen in figure XXX – surpassing the UK in 2010 and Germany in 2011 (Statistisches Bundesamt 2012, Statistics Lithuania 2012).

## Comparing wind resources (Generation from installed capacity)

[Double check and make table - add notes, equations and sources]
DE: 5.5 m/s (30m) - Reference site
LT: 6.3 m/s (30m) - Average of 3 measurements, comparable to DE.
UK: 7.2 m/s (30m) - Average wind speed UK, comparable to DE.

To acutely compare the costs of Germany, the UK and Lithuania we will adjust according to each countries wind resources. The UK is endowed with stronger winds and therefore its costs of producing one MWh will be lower than Germany and Lithuania. Following to procedure of Buttler and Neuhoff (2008, 2004) we will not use country average wind speeds, since they might not correspond to the wind resources at the sites that are accessibile to project developers. Instead we will look at the electricity generated relative to the installed capacity. This will serve as a crude measure for the output of the wind turbines in use. In the first years of deployment, capacity often double on a year-to-year basis, for this reason we have slightly adjusted the method, using installed capacity (MW) lagged one year. This measure is better attuned to the fast expansion of capcity, since [reason!? Lagged puts more weight on turbines installed in the last half of a year, where non-lagged puts more weight on turbines installed in first half of a year!? Seasonal construction and wind power variability!? Are the results later on in this paper robust to this adjustment!? "How much did you produces this year, with the capcity you had available at the end of last year" vs "How much did you produce this year, with the capacity you will have available in the end of this year"!?]. 

It is important to note that neither the NFFO or RO in the UK, nor the feed-in tariffs in Lithuania, differentiate with respect to wind resources. While the German feed-in tariffs from 2000 and onwards offer higher tariffs for less windy sites. \footnote{High preforming sites reaching 150% of the performance of a reference site receive 9.1-7.9 c/kWh for five years and thereafter 6.2-5.4 c/kWh. While for low preforming sites the 9.1-7.9 c/kWh rate is extended after the 5 years, by two months for every 0.75% the low sites are below the 150% reference site. These rate where revised in 2004 to respectively 8.7 c/kWh and 5.5 c/kWh, were the high-five-year rate will decline with 2% annually (Lauber and Mez 2004).}
[More on the implications of this - e.g that developers choose high wind sites - and why its *important to note*?]

Figure XXX presents the electricity production from the lagged installed capcity. As a result of the better wind resources we see (as we expected) that output is higher in the UK compared to Germany, with exception of the early 1990s. Butler and Neuhoff (2008) explains that this intial low output in the UK was "due to low turbine ratings at experimental sites, but increased with the increase in turbine rating throughout the 1990s" and they further note that the "increase in hub height – thus capturing higher wind speeds – has contributed to the upward trend [in the UK and has prevented a further decrease in output per turbine in Germany]". Caution is advised when evaluating the output of Lithuania in 2004-2005, since the numbers are very sensative to rounding and measurements errors. \footnote{Capacity was reported to be 1 MW in both years, while electricity generated was reported respectivly as 1 and 2 GWh in those years by EUROSTAT. The National Control Commission for Prices and Energy reported that they had issued permits that cumulative had capacities of 0.85 and 0.99 MW (NCC 2006, tabel 41), while the European Wind Energy Association reports installed capacity of 7 MW in both years (EWEA 2006). Statistics Lithuania report electricity generated as 1.2 and 1.8 GWh (Statistics Lithuania 2006).} After 2006 the Lithuanian output is situated in the vicinity of the output of the UK [reflecting that wind deployment has accrued in the locations where wind resources are highest? or at least compariable to that of the UK].
