## Comparing installed capacity

Both Germany and the UK introduced renewable energy incentive policies around the same time (1991 and 1990 respectively). Deployment has been much greater in Germany compared to the UK as seen in figure XXX. In Germany deployment increased steadily after the first policy was introduced. While deployment in the UK remained low under the NFFO system and only started to pick up after the RO system was introduced in 2002. Both the NFFO and RO have under-preformed with regards to the targets set by government (Dow and Wood 2011). Lithuania has arrived much later at the game – first introducing feed-in tariffs in 2002. Although its deployment in absolute terms (MW) has been slower,  the rate of increase of wind power as percentage of total electricity produced has been faster than both Germany and the UK as seen in figure XXX, surpassing the UK in 2010 and Germany in 2011 (Statistisches Bundesamt 2012, Statistics Lithuania 2012).
